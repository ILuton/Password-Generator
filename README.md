# Random Password Generator

## Description

- The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator. 
- It allowed be to practice using functions and for loops
- The hardest part of the project for me was making it so the button would re-generate another password after each click. 

## Usage

- In order to create your own random password you can follow the link provided.
- It will ask for your password preferences (uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers).
- You will also be prompted to proved a length of how long you would like your password to be. 
- If you do not like the first generated passcode you can re-click the "generate" button until you have one you like. 
- Hope you enjoy!
